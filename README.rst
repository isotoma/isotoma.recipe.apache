Apache buildout recipe
======================

This package provides buildout_ recipes for the configuration of apache.  This
has a number of features that we have found useful in production, such as
support for long CA chains, htpasswd authentication protection and the support
for optional templates provided with the buildout.

We use the system apache, so this recipe will not install apache for you.  If
you wish to install apache, use `zc.recipe.cmmi`_ perhaps.
